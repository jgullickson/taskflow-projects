Samples from a growing library of gamified cogntive-training tasks used for research studies at UMN. The premise behind gamification is to both challenge and engage research participants as they undergo intensive cognitive training regimens paried with transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS).

These tasks are based on standard psychological tasks that engage working memory, and include variations of:
  - N-back
  - Flanker
  - Dot Pattern Expectancy (DPX)
